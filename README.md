# Bell-Nozzle
This project showcases the optimization of a converging-diverging nozzle into a bell nozzle using Python for calculations and SolidWorks for CAD modeling. The design enhances efficiency by minimizing losses and improving flow characteristics.
If you need the CAD file in any format, feel free to message me directly! I'm happy to share and discuss the design.
